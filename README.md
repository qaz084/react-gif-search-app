#  A simple React gif-search app 💻

A little app that consumes the **GYPHY API**, and search gifs.

I've made this to practice **REACT v18** following an excercise from an Udemy course.

It's done using VITE and YARN

I added extra functionality like a delete button, wich calls a click event and use the name of the category clicked in order to filter it out from the componnent state.This performs a re-rendering of the page without that category.

Also,the input has a basic character length validation. It can`t be empty.

* _In case you want to try it:  https://reactgifsearch.netlify.app/_
* _In case you wan to explore the code, remember that you will need to [install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install "Yarn") .Then In your Vscode terminal write "yarn" in order to install all the used dependencies._
